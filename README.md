Group members: Kiran Sapra, Kuldeep Garg Project: House Price Predictor 
For the final project, we have decided to choose the house price predictor option because being students we change houses very often and the house market is a hot topic we have been discussing for a while. I am also sure this would be a very helpful tool for new residents looking to buy a house 
In conclusion, this is a service we are interested in being tenants and will start working on soon. 
Deliverable 1 
For the first deliverable, we downloaded the data set and read it. We practiced GIT programming. We understood the process and learnt how to use Pandas. 
Deliverable 2 
For the second deliverable, we explored our data set, worked with it a little and as mentioned in the deliverable, we loaded our data set into data frame. This deliverable gave us the opportunity to practice our GIT CLI. 
Deliverable 3 
For this deliverable, we started working on the Discussion write up as well as a README report. We also started working with linear regression, exploring the data and try to create plots and graphs. There were a lot of challenges for this deliverable so we did use online resources to understand and learnt learnt about SKLearn and other dataframes too. We will however commit the discussion and README report draft next week. 
Deliverable 4
For our final deliverable, we finished all requirements of the project and we worked on our discussion and comparing different regression models.
